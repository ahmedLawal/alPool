/**
 * Capacity-ledger LIVE invariant check (2026-08-23).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The ledger shipped with 46 unit + integration tests, four
 * adversarial review rounds, and a real-component render — all green — and its
 * PRODUCTION DATA was wrong twice within 24 hours:
 *   v1.8.0  OAuth reset-stamp jitter recorded 9 cycles for one real 5h window and
 *           dated "weekly" cycles a week into the future.
 *   v1.8.1  A probe answering late delivered an already-expired stamp; the close
 *           honored it and wrote a 14.6-minute "complete cycle" of 21k tokens.
 * Neither was visible to a test, because every fixture used clean synthetic stamps.
 * Only reading the live ledger found them.
 *
 * So this asserts the invariants against the REAL state file the running proxy
 * writes. A test proves the code; this proves the data.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/capacity-invariants.mjs            # human-readable, exit 1 on violation
 *   node scripts/capacity-invariants.mjs --json     # machine-readable for the monitor
 *
 * Exit: 0 clean · 1 violations found · 2 could not read (never conflated with clean).
