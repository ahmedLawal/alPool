## [1.13.0] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Read-time junk floor — a sub-window 'complete' cycle never reaches the columns

## [1.10.2] - 2026-08-24

## [1.10.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- True-capacity ledger — observed tokens per completed cycle, TUI capacity page

### Changed

- Simplify pass — dedupe stamp-advance call sites, share the screen-write tail, drop dead tuple element and a vacuous loop

### Fixed

- Red-team round 1 — both close paths, unbumped merge write, downtime-based partial, calendar 7d window, stream-death accrual
- Red-team round 2 — single-shot rollover, clock-anchored 7d window, same-boundary fold, weekly-close pin, narrow-width page
- Red-team round 3 residuals — restore reset-log/session-signal path, fold only complete tails, fail-loud drain bail, pin M2/M4/M5
- Pad-name truncation aligned every column — the round-3 RT3-4 residual

### Fixed

- Z.ai CREDIT_LIMIT plans, inert disabled-account guard, dead code

## [1.5.68] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- Disabled accounts no longer spend refresh tokens; provider-only fleets boot

## [1.5.49] - 2026-07-26

- Narrow cross-provider pinning — Kimi/GLM sessions CAN use Claude (react-and-heal)

## [1.5.15] - 2026-07-08

## [1.5.14] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- A per-model (Fable) rejection blocked the WHOLE account (display + routing)

## [1.5.13] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- Interactive `r` restart hung blank — supervisor respawned worker with a dead socket

## [1.5.12] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- Per-model (Fable) weekly-cap awareness — balance a capped model to headroom accounts instead of failing

## [1.5.11] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- Clean shutdown on terminal close + restore TUI on interactive reload

## [1.5.3] - 2026-06-29

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-27

### Documentation

- Mark #3 import-removal DONE (was stale; shipped in b6353fa)

### Fixed

- Hold a signed-thinking session behind the FIFO queue, never error-kill it

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Near-zero-downtime reload via supervisor-owns-socket + single-writer baton

### Changed

- Cover baton, single-writer, gen guard, drain, rollback, TTY, storm
- Partial blocker/major fixes from code review — INCOMPLETE, DO NOT SHIP
- B2 asserts the no-parent-swallow invariant (no hang + every served response worker-stamped), not a brittle 200/200 throughput count that flaked under concurrent-subprocess contention
- Run files serially (--test-concurrency=1) so subprocess-heavy reload tests don't contend
- Per-file process isolation + fail-fast caps so the reload suite doesn't wedge under resource pressure
- Guard the child exit-wait so cleanup cannot hang forever
- Extract M4 (state-generation) into its own file for a fresh process
- Drop the SIGUSR2 self-kill from M4 (it terminated the supervisor)

### Documentation

- Mark #1 Phase 2 safe-point rebalancing DONE (shipped v1.4.0); herd-jitter tracked as Phase 3
- #6 re-integrated onto main (feat/reload-reintegrate, clean merge); 6 must-fixes + brick-safety council remain before ship
- #6 RE-ASSESSED — product done + brick-safety torture test PROVEN green; real blocker is integration-test contention flakiness, not missing must-fixes
- #6 deep-dive — brick-safety proven, suite made reliable, SIGUSR2 self-kill fixed; single residual = M4 state-generation advancement (product-vs-test call)

### Fixed

- Force the final quota flush on baton-release + graceful-shutdown (was a silent no-op)
- Forced final flush bypasses the cross-worker generation guard (review nit)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- #1 safe-point session rebalancing — drain a bound session off a hot account onto fresh capacity

### Documentation

- Mark #5 TUI clarity DONE (shipped v1.3.1)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- #5 clarity — throttled countdown + clearer 'Now' load label

### Fixed

- Bound throttled countdown to single-unit so multi-hour cooldowns don't shift the column

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Hold the session indefinitely on rate-limit + raw-weekly routing consistency (issue #2)

### Documentation

### Fixed

- Recover temporary OAuth refresh failures

- Avoid listener gap during restart drain
- Self-heal shared Anthropic throttling
- Make overload recovery and restart deterministic
- Fail over before declaring Anthropic outage
- Complete honest no-route message + review findings
- Drop a restored quota utilization that has no reset window
- Identity-restore test needs a reset window now that bare utilization is dropped
- Fall back to macOS Keychain when ~/.claude/.credentials.json is absent
- Bound shutdown drain to 15s so q/Ctrl-C/SIGTERM quits under a flood
- Read legacy x-teamclaude-* headers as fallback for x-maxpool-*
