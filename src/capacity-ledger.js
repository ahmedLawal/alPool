/**
 * True-capacity ledger — observed tokens per completed window cycle.
 *
 * The measurement model (user spec 2026-08-22): when a 5h or weekly window completes,
 * the tokens delivered during that cycle ARE the account's measured capacity for the
 * window. History per account per window: last / prev / prev-1 / avg3 / avg10 /
 * all-time — in tokens, so a GLM row and a Claude row compare apples to apples.
 *
 * The no-weekly account (legacy z.ai TOKENS_LIMIT, weeklyAbsent) has no weekly TANK:
 * it gets full 5h cycle history plus a rolling-7d THROUGHPUT from UTC day buckets —
 * a volume, never a limit, rendered distinctly.
 *
 * PURE: no I/O, injected clock. Persistence + accrual seams live in account-manager /
 * index; this module owns the data model and its invariants.
 * Pre-mortem (2026-08-22) blockers B1/B2 + majors M3-M7 are the load-bearing comments.
