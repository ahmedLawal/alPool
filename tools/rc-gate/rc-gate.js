// rc-gate — CONNECT-MITM front door that lets Claude Code Remote Control
// work through maxpool.
//
// WHY: Claude Code (≥2.1.196) disables Remote Control unless
// ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL is unset-or-api.anthropic.com (binary check is a literal
// host-string compare — M$()/NT() in v2.1.251). Pointing it at
// 127.0.0.1:3456 therefore kills RC. But the CLI fully honors HTTPS_PROXY
// CONNECT tunneling, and Remote Control's bridge (wss://bridge.claudeusercontent.com)
// is a separate host that must reach Anthropic DIRECT.
//
// HOW: sessions run with ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL UNSET + HTTPS_PROXY=this gate +
// NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=mkcert root. The CLI connects to api.anthropic.com:443
// via CONNECT; we MITM exactly that host (cert minted by mkcert for
// api.anthropic.com), terminate TLS, and forward the decrypted HTTP request
// to maxpool with x-maxpool-* headers re-applied. CONNECTs to any other host
// are blind-tunneled untouched — bridge, statsig, sentry, everything else
// reaches the real internet directly.
//
// Upstream auth: maxpool routes by header profile and ignores client OAuth for
// account selection (cc wrappers already send x-maxpool-profile). The client's
// Authorization is stripped before forwarding so the pool's per-account tokens
// are the only credentials upstream sees.

// headers timer, gets destroyed, and RECONNECTS into the same saturated pool. That is the
// vicious cycle behind "could not reach the Remote Control server for about 30 minutes"
// while the network was fine: stalls climbed 823/hr (02:00) -> 4,100/hr (08:00).
// Each RC session legitimately holds MULTIPLE long-poll sockets open by design
// (/worker/events, /heartbeat, /client/presence), so the cap must scale with sessions,
// not with cores. 512 leaves headroom for ~100 sessions; the 2026-09-04 fd leak is fixed
